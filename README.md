1. Purpose 

In this programming assignment we will extend the sleeping-barber problem to a multiple sleeping barbers problem where many customers visit a barbershop and receive a haircut service from any one of the available barbers in the shop.  
  
2. Sleeping-Barber Problem 

A barbershop consists of a waiting room with n waiting chairs and a barber room with one barber chair. If there are no customers to be served, the barber goes to sleep. If a customer enters the barbershop and all the waiting chairs are occupied, then the customer leaves the shop. If the barber is busy but waiting chairs are available, then the customer sits in one of the free chairs. If the barber is asleep, the customer wakes up the barber and gets served.
